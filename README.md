## 📖 About

Univrs.io advocates for publicly-funded cloud infrastructure where every person's data is stored safely and not owned by anyone else. We combine technology exploration with policy advocacy, drawing on mycelial economics principles—distributed coordination without centralized control.

### Core Principles

- **Data Sovereignty** — Your data belongs to you, not corporations
- **Regenerative Economics** — Systems that increase capacity over time
- **Decentralized Coordination** — No central control points
- **Democratic Governance** — Community-defined algorithms
- **Bioregional Integration** — Economic flows connected to ecological health
