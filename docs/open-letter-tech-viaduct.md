# AN OPEN LETTER TO TECH VIADUCT

## Decentralized Infrastructure for Resilient Government Services

**From: Univrs.io**  
**To: The Tech Viaduct Team & Digital Commons Builders Everywhere**  
**Date: January 2026**

Dear Mikey, Marina, Jonathan, Jenny, and the Tech Viaduct team,

We've read your manifesto. We share your diagnosis. We've been building the cure.

**You wrote:** *"Radical reform that engages with all dimensions of the bureaucracy is necessary."*

**We agree.** But we'd add: any reform dependent on a single election cycle inherits a fatal vulnerability. The next administration can reverse it. We've seen this movie before.

**You wrote:** *"DOGE has demonstrated something valuable: rapid government change is possible with sufficient political will."*

**We agree.** And we'd add: decentralized infrastructure demonstrates something equally valuable—rapid change that *no administration can reverse*.

---

## What We've Built

While you've been preparing policy, we've been shipping code:

🔗 **DOL** — A programming language where specification *is* implementation  
*522 tests passing. Self-hosting compiler. Open source.*

🔗 **ENR** — Economic primitives for regenerative systems  
*Entropy taxation. Revival pools. Resource gradients.*

🔗 **Network** — P2P mesh that has no off switch  
*Gossipsub. Peer discovery. Distributed consensus.*

🔗 **VUDO** — Sandboxed execution for citizen-authored applications  
*Wasmtime-based. Capability security. Run "Spirits" safely.*

This isn't vaporware. It's working infrastructure, tested and open.

---

## The Synthesis We Propose

**Tech Viaduct provides:** Political pathway, Day 1 executive orders, procurement reform expertise, talent network.

**Univrs.io provides:** Technical architecture that survives political cycles, working implementations, FedRAMP-aware design.

**Together we offer:** Citizen-owned services that work regardless of who wins the next election.

## The Apollo Parallel

The Apollo program succeeded not because NASA was immune to politics, but because it created capabilities that *outlasted any administration*. Integrated circuits, satellite communications, materials science—the knowledge was decentralized even as the program was centralized.

Digital infrastructure deserves the same resilience.

---

## Our Ask

**1. Technical Review**  
Evaluate our architecture against your service delivery requirements. Tell us where we're wrong.

**2. Policy Alignment**  
Ensure Day 1 executive orders don't inadvertently preclude distributed approaches.

**3. Talent Bridge**  
The same people who would staff a reformed USDS are potential "Nexus Rebels" in a decentralized commons.

---

## The Invitation

We're not asking you to choose between policy reform and technical alternatives. We're asking you to recognize they're complementary.

Build the policy bridge. We'll keep building the infrastructure.

When the moment comes—whether that's a favorable election, a state-level pilot, or a community that decides to run its own digital commons—the technology will be ready.

**Of the People. By the People. FOR the People.**

You're right that government services are broken.
You're right that Day 1 readiness matters.

But any solution dependent on elections inherits the vulnerability of elections.

We've been building the alternative. 🧵

2/ While you've been preparing policy, we've shipped code:

• DOL: 522 tests. Self-hosting compiler.
• Network: P2P mesh with no off switch.
• ENR: Economic primitives for regenerative systems.
• VUDO: Sandboxed execution for citizen apps.

Digital infrastructure deserves the same resilience.

Policy reform + decentralized infrastructure = services that survive political cycles.

4/ We're not asking you to choose.

We're asking you to recognize they're complementary.

Build the policy bridge.

AN OPEN LETTER TO TECH VIADUCT

The Searchlight Institute's Tech Viaduct project correctly identifies that government services need radical reform—and that Day 1 readiness matters.

But I'd offer a complement to their approach: any solution dependent on a single election inherits the vulnerability of that election.

At Univrs.io, we've been building decentralized infrastructure that survives political cycles:

• DOL: A programming language with 522 passing tests
• Network: P2P mesh using gossipsub protocol  
• ENR: Economic primitives for regenerative systems
• VUDO: Sandboxed execution for citizen applications

The Apollo program created capabilities that outlasted any administration. Digital infrastructure deserves the same resilience.

Tech Viaduct provides the political pathway.
Univrs.io provides the technical architecture.
Together: citizen-owned services that work regardless of who wins.
